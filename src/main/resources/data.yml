# Those under here doesn't matter on GroupManager... Permissions 2.0 had it.

##
# Groups can contain inheritance.
#   To make a group inherit the permissions from another 
#   group simply place the groups name in the "inheritance:" 
#   field seperated by commas.
#
#   Example: inheritance: Default,Admins,
##
#   All permissions including the asterisks must be placed in single quotes.
#   like so:
#
#       - 'essentials.spawn'
#
#   Otherwise errors will happen!
##
#   Globalized Permission settings:
#
#       If a permission contains periods (.) you can denote a globalized parameter:
#
#           - 'essentials.*'
#
#       This will allow you to use all general commands.
#
##
#
#   Single Asterisk denotes all commands:
#
#       - '*'
